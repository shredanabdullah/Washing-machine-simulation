# Microcontroller-Based Washing Machine Simulation Using PicsimLab
Washing machine simulation.
<br />
1 Overview
<br />
1.1 Purpose
<br />
This project focuses on simulating a washing machine using PicsimLab, aiming to
replicate real-world washing machine functionality in a virtual environment. The project
begins with a comprehensive understanding of washing machine components, cycles,
and operations. Parameters defining laundry status, such as fabric type, load size, and
water level, are identified.
<br />
1.2 Scope
<br />
This simulation project provides valuable insights into washing machine operations,
control system design, and simulation techniques. Participants gain practical experience
in applying algorithms to simulate intelligent appliances, contributing to a better
understanding of laundry automation.
