# Microcontroller-Based Washing Machine Simulation Using PicsimLab
Washing machine simulation.
1 Overview
1.1 Purpose
This project focuses on simulating a washing machine using PicsimLab, aiming to
replicate real-world washing machine functionality in a virtual environment. The project
begins with a comprehensive understanding of washing machine components, cycles,
and operations. Parameters defining laundry status, such as fabric type, load size, and
water level, are identified.

1.2 Scope
This simulation project provides valuable insights into washing machine operations,
control system design, and simulation techniques. Participants gain practical experience
in applying algorithms to simulate intelligent appliances, contributing to a better
understanding of laundry automation.
